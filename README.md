A program that finds a network of standard-value resistors equal to a particular resistance. It needs some more testing before I can call it complete, but the program should also work with capacitors and inductors, as well as calculate the equivalent tolerance for each network (for when tolerances are being mixed).

For example, I used this program to find out that a resistor with a nominal value of 3.14159k can be created from just four E12 resistors (((68 || 3.3k) + 3.3k) || 47k). Of course, the level of precision in this instance is overkill. Nonetheless, this tool should still be helpful when the lack of flexibility of other calculators becomes too impeding.
