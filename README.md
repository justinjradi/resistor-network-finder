A program that finds a network of standard-value resistors/capacitors/inductors equal to a particular impedance given a max number of components. Need to fix some bugs but it seems to be working for large resistances. For example, using this program I found that ((68 || 3.3k) + 3.3k) || 47k is exactly 3.14159k!
